PaulOS

My take on geohot's fromthetransistor operating system section (section 5)

Kernel Design: Monolithic
(C, ~2500 lines of code)

OS developed using info from [https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page]

Linux-ish:
* only user space threads
* open, read, write, close
* fork, execve, wait, sleep, exit
* mmap, munmap, mprotect
* Consider the debug interface you are using, ranging from printf to perhaps a gdbremote stub into kernel

Build:
./build.sh

Clean:
./clean.sh

Run (using qemu-system-i386):
./run.sh

For multiboot kernel (directly without bootable medium):
$ qemu-system-i386 -kernel PaulOS.bin

STEPS:
- interrupt handlers
- process management
- shell
- paging + memory map (physical first, then paging)
- usermode -> syscalls (open, read, write, ...)
- drivers(?)
- filesystem


TODO:
* output object files in build/ (modify Makefile)
* fix numeric to string convertions

* implement interrupts and syscalls
* plan memory map (virtual and physical)
* move on with syscalls
* malloc/free (mmap, munmap, mprotect)
* open, read, write, close
* fork, execve, wait, sleep, exit
* build drivers
